      <h1>Connection Lost / Offline</h1>
      <p>The platform is currently offline, or your internet connection has been disrupted.</p>
      <p>If this outage was unexpected, it may indicate a potential cyber attack or an unforeseen system failure. Cyber threats, including network intrusions and denial-of-service attacks, can cause sudden disruptions to online services.</p>
      <p>Please check your local network connection to rule out any personal connectivity issues. If the problem persists and was unplanned, it may be due to a broader technical incident.</p>
      <p>For real-time updates and system status information, please visit: <a href="https://sector-7status.pages.dev/" target="_blank">sector-7status.pages.dev</a> (if accessible). You can also check our <a href="announcements.html">Announcements Page</a> if you can reach it via an alternative route.</p>
      <p>Our team is actively monitoring the situation and working to restore service as quickly as possible. We appreciate your patience and vigilance.</p>
